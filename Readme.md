## Identification of Sympathetic Nervous System Activation from Skin Conductance: A Sparse Decomposition Approach with Physiological Priors

This code is written by Md. Rafiul Amin in affiliation with Computational Medicine Lab at University of Houston. Rafiul was mentored by Rose T. Faghih during this project.
Please contact Rose T. Faghih (email: rtfaghih@uh.edu) for any question regarding the code.

Please run the 'Auditory_Stimulation_Data_Experiment.m'. 
The results will be saved in 'Deconv_Results' (If folder does not exists, it will be created.)
One example result for participant 11 is provided with a function to plot the results.

The code is based on the following paper:

Amin, Md Rafiul, and Rose T. Faghih. "Identification of Sympathetic Nervous System Activation from Skin Conductance: A Sparse Decomposition Approach with Physiological Priors." IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering (2020).
